I am a 5th year PhD candidate in the Cambridge-Tübingen programme, co-supervised by Bernhard Schölkopf at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen and Adrian Weller at the University of Cambridge, where I spent the first year of my PhD.

My research interests lie at the intersection of causal inference and machine learning, see Research Interests and the below publications for more details.

Previously, I studied Mathematics (B.Sc. + M.Sci.) at Imperial College London (UK) and Artificial Intelligence (M.Sc.) at UPC Barcelona (Spain) and at TU Delft (Netherlands).

I am originally from the beautiful Hamburg in northern Germany.
