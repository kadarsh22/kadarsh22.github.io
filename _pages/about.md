# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm [Your Name], a PhD student at the University of Surrey, working under the supervision of **[Dr. Lu Yin](https://luuyin.com/)** and **[Dr. Xiatian Zhu](https://surrey-uplab.github.io/)**.  

ðŸ”¬ My research focuses on **Robustness and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Generalization**, aiming to develop models that perform reliably in real-world scenarios beyond their training data.  

ðŸš€ I'm actively seeking **internships and research collaborations**! If you're interested in working together, feel free to reach out. Let's build something impactful!
